# Distribution System of Marine Fish Caught by Fishermen for Sale to Consumers Based on a Mobile Apps (FISHKU)

Indonesia as an archipelagic country has a large enough potential for fish resources (6,520,100 tons/year),
as stated in the Decree of the Minister of Marine Affairs and Fisheries number KEP.45/MEN/2011 concerning the potential of Indonesia's marine resources. 
The low consumption of fish is partly due to unstable fish prices in various regions. One of these potentials is the sale of fish where the price of fish 
is prone to being marked up by middlemen because there is no relationship between fishermen and buyers/consumers, middlemen are the liaison between fishermen 
and buyers/consumers. Of course, it also requires marketing to promote and sell the processed fishery products, so as to spread freely in the community. 
Therefore, the necessary analysis and design of e-commerce for the marketing of processed fishery. This application aims to digitalize indonesian fisheries 
and to prevent price monopoly by middlemen so the fishermen's income can be increased.
